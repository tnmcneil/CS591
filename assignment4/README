to run the model use command python ner.py and to score use python
conlleval.py results.txt

The current submission is my unconstrained model, to run the constrained model
comment out lines 120-125 and uncomment lines 96-100 and use the same commands
to run and save the predictions to results.txt

If you wish to save both versions rename the write to file on line 159

Included in this submission is ner.py which has my modified code, as well as
two text files, constrained_results.txt and unconstrained_results.txt which
contain my predictions from my two best constrained and unconstrained models.
And also my writeup.
