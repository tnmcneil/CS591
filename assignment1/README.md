Homework 1 submission by Theresa McNeil
To run assignment 1, make sure to have files in the following structure:
assignment1\
	hw1.py
	syllables.py
	ngram_counts.gz
	data\
		complex_words_development
		complex_words_test_unlabeled
		complex_words_training
to run just use "python hw1.py"

*please note only hw1.py has been submitted because it was the only file modified*

When the program runs it prints the results of each evaluation to the screen, with a line above describing what the results come from.

Separately I am sending test_labels.txt which contains my labels for the test set.
