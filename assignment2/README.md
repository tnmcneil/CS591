to run make sure all files are in same directory, including:
hw2.py
play_genre.txt
play_names.txt
vocab.txt
char_names.txt
will_play_text.csv

after that just run python hw2.py and the respective similar plays/words/characters will spit out

I am submitting my code and char_names.txt and play_genre.txt which I have created myself when looking for patterns.
I have not pickled my PPMI matrix,  however the code takes under 2 minutes to run.
